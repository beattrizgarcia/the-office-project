    <h2>Why "The Office"?</h2>
    <h3>Dwight, you ignorant slut!</h3>
    <p>The question here is: why haven't you seen "The Office"? It's mockumentary format, the lack of a laughing track on the background, it's campy style and the writing itself makes it the funniest tv show ever created.
        <br> The storyline is about a mediocre paper company in the hands of Scranton, PA branch manager Michael Scott. It follows the everyday lives of the manager and the employees he "manages." The crew follows the employees around 24/7 and captures their quite humorous and bizarre encounters as they will do what it takes to keep the company thriving.</p>
